abstract = {A low speed sensorless position control method for brushless DC motor based on pulse pulse high frequency voltage injection is proposed according to the characteristic that the brushless DC motor (BLDCM) which is produced at present makes the counter electromotive force waveform show sinusoidal waveform in view of the problem that it is difficult to accurately obtain the rotor position and speed of the brushless DC motor at zero and low speed. Its principle is to inject high frequency sinusoidal voltage signal on the estimated direct axis of the synchronous rotating coordinate system so that the motor can generate saturated salient effect, obtain the estimation error containing the rotor position information, and by detecting the output current of PI regulator of quadrature axis current loop, and then estimate the initial position of the rotor and judges the magnetic pole, realize the determination of the actual rotor position, finally, realize the non-position static low speed control of BLDCM by adding current and speed rings. According to the simulation test, it shows that this method can detect the position and speed of the motor rotor well at both zero speed and low speed.}
